# How to program on a school chromebook

## Introduction

Some High Schoolers have been lended a Chromebook (or some other cheap laptop, maybe it's running Windows, or ChromeOS). If you're a programmer who wants one of those systems to be useful to you (for programming purposes), you may encounter a problem.

Some of these problems are:

1. You do not have terminal access. This one is basically guarenteed to be the case for a school laptop.

2. You cannot install any applications such as Visual Studio Code. This one is also very likely to be the case.

3. Many websites are blocked. If this is somehow not the case, then remember, the wireless router stores your search history.

If you follow this tutorial, you should be able to program at a basic level on your system

## Setup the tools as needed

In your device's web browser, visit the link for [My Binder](https://mybinder.org/)

The website that you will be taken to is a web development environment for Python, but it can be used for other languages with some configuration. If you scroll down enough on the page, you will come across a sction that will ask for things such as a GitHub repository that it can use. In that section, input the link for this GitHub repository ``https://github.com/buzz-buzz-Alaska/Dimond_HS_tools``
